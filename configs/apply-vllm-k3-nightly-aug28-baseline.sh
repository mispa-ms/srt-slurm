# PR #53324 supersedes the older Mooncake/DCP commits in
# xinli-sw/vllm:k3-agent-all. The supplemental patch carries only the runtime
# changes still missing from 6f7df92a8: PP speculative decoding and its DSpark
# loading fixes, DCP dummy-batch sequence lengths, hybrid load-failure recovery,
# and hybrid cache-accounting safeguards. Changes already merged upstream are
# deliberately not replayed.
